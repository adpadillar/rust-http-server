# rust-http-server

I'm learning Rust and I'm trying to build a simple HTTP server. I quickly had the idea to create a videochat app with it. I'm using websockets to communicate between the server and the client.

Right now it streams video one-way. A "sender" can stream their camera and several "receivers" can watch the stream. I'm planning to add audio and two-way communication.
